## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Cognitive Wireless Communication System.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything and evrything about wireless communication and computer vision.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on wireless-communication projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with integrating deep learning into my wireless communication project.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first wireless voice transmission wasn't done with a fancy smartphone, but with a 'spark gap transmitter'? It was like yelling through lightning. Now we are complaining about 5G speeds. I guess it's progress. I'm exploring the magic of making data dance through air. Feel free to join the signals party.
